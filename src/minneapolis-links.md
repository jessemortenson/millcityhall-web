# Minneapolis Links and Resources

Want to follow local politics? Pay way less attention to the day-to-day ravings of Donald Trump and read good local news sources.

## Super local
- [Cam's monthly column in Southside Pride](https://southsidepride.com/category/columnists/cam-gordon/cams-corner/)
- [Wedge Live!](https://wedgelive.com/): Irreverant and dogged hyperlocal coverage of Minneapolis. Your best bet is following on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wedge.live) or subscribing to the podcast/YouTube.

## Twin Cities & MN coverage
- [MN Reformer](https://minnesotareformer.com/): strong, critical coverage of MN and Twin Cities politics
- [Sahan Journal](https://sahanjournal.com/): also strong coverage of local news, with a special depth of coverage around issues impacting immigrant communities.
- [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/): some of the coverage is pretty shallow, and the obnoxious national columnists in the opinion section are better avioded, but the Strib is worth reading for Susan Du's local journalism alone.
