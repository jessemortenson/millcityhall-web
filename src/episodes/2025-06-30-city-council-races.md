date: 2025-06-30T00:00:00.0-5
description: "On election night, will we see the progressive wing of the council increase to a majority of 8 members, or drop to a minority of 5? With three open seats and three incumbents in real contests, there is a lot at stake. We look at how policy divisions have played out under the current council to provide a sense of what could change if elections swing the balance. And we go race-by-race through the six wards where we see a real contest, to evaluate the candidates, their support, and the positions and framing they lead with. Recorded 6/25/25."

On election night, will we see the progressive wing of the council increase to a majority of 8 members, or drop to a minority of 5? With three open seats and three incumbents in real contests, there is a lot at stake. We look at how policy divisions have played out under the current council to provide a sense of what could change if elections swing the balance. And we go race-by-race through the six wards where we see a real contest, to evaluate the candidates, their support, and the positions and framing they lead with.

We recorded this episode on June 25, 2025.

## Production notes

Jesse added musical cues, let us know if you hate them! Also it started raining for a bit in the middle of the episode (better than the leaf blower last time).
