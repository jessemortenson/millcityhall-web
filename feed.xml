            <title>What Do They Stand For? Mayoral Candidate Platforms and Progressive Policy</title>
            <link>https://millcityhall.com/episodes/2025-07-14-mayoral-platforms/index.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>With the DFL city convention right around the corner, what should we expect a mayor to champion? What challenges face the people of Minneapolis in 2025? How are these campaigns talking about public policy responses to those challenges, and what policies should WE be talking about? In this in-depth episode, we walk through a number of major policy areas: public safety, federal fascism, housing, climate change, transportation, workers rights, the economy and more! Recorded 7/9/25 and 7/11/25.</p>

            <title>Will the Council Swing? We Look at Key Council Races w/ Robin Garwood</title>
            <link>https://millcityhall.com/episodes/2025-06-30-city-council-races/index.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>On election night, will we see the progressive wing of the council increase to a majority of 8 members, or drop to a minority of 5? With three open seats and three incumbents in real contests, there is a lot at stake. We look at how policy divisions have played out under the current council to provide a sense of what could change if elections swing the balance. And we go race-by-race through the six wards where we see a real contest, to evaluate the candidates, their support, and the positions and framing they lead with. Recorded 6/25/25.</p>

                <p>With unprecendented big money pouring into a full slate of city elections, we assess the Minneapolis political landscape, with special guest Robin Garwood. This episode features a deep dive on new phenomenon of political action committees acting as stealth political parties.
